# Laurie_Wired_CAPTCHA_Challenge

My submission to https://github.com/LaurieWired/Halloween_2024_Programming_Challenge

 Hello this is my somewhat evangelion themed captcha (sorry I have not seen Stiens Gate)

 The goal is to click on the hexes on the big hex grid such that the red hexes match the ones in the tiny hex grid

 compile by running `go build main.go`
 (you may need to install the dependencies listed here https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/install.html)
 (also to cross compile to windows run `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 ^C build main.go`)

 then just run that exe

 Thank you so much for checking out my captcha, had to throw this together before I left on a trip to Europe!

 LOVE THE CHANNEL SO MUCH!!!!! <3
